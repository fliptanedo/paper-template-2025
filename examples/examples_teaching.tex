\section{Teaching Examples}

For lecture notes it is useful to have some framed environments to highlight examples and exercises. In the past I have used \texttt{framed} and \texttt{mdframed}. I think \texttt{tcolorbox} may be the best option now.

% \begin{tcolorbox}
% 	⟨environment content⟩
% \end{tcolorbox}

\begin{theorem}[Flip's Theorem]
This is an example theorem.

\begin{exercise}[Solving a differential equation]
  Solve the following differential equation.
  \label{ex:solve:ode}
\end{exercise} 
\noindent Can you solve Exercise~\ref{ex:solve:ode}?


\begin{bigidea}[environments]
  With \texttt{tcolorbox}, one may `dress' existing environments in boxes. The call to the environments is unchanged.
